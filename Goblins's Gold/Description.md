**Risk Management:**

**Optimization Parameters:**
- **ROI (Return on Investment):**
  - Specific ROI targets at different time intervals (0: 17.8%, 24: 8.4%, 36: 2.8%, 130: 0%).

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
1. **Backtesting and Hyperoptimization:**
   - Thoroughly backtest the strategy across multiple pairs and timeframes.
   - Use hyperoptimization to refine the parameters further, especially for the periods of SMAs and EMAs, as well as RSI thresholds.

2. **Diversification:**
   - Consider adding additional indicators or modifying existing ones to diversify the entry and exit conditions. For example, adding Volume indicators or more complex candlestick pattern recognition.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Review and possibly adjust stoploss and trailing stop parameters based on backtesting results. Too tight stoploss or trailing stops can lead to frequent premature exits.

4. **Entry and Exit Refinements:**
   - Consider additional conditions to filter false signals, such as combining RSI with other momentum indicators or using a longer lookback period for trend confirmation.

5. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Implement more performance metrics in the strategy, such as Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and maximum drawdown, to evaluate and compare the strategy's performance more comprehensively.

By refining these aspects and ensuring thorough backtesting, the "GoblinsGold" strategy can be fine-tuned to potentially enhance profitability and reduce risk.
